## Website Wireframe Sketch

This is a wireframe sketch I’ve created with a focus on user-friendliness, especially since the primary users will be children. My aim was to design an interface that is not only fun and educational, but also enjoyable.

## GETTING STARTED
## Instructions:

While this game is designed to encompass four categories, in the current version 1.0, only the Math category is available. This category further branches into sub-categories such as Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division. 

* Upon clicking or opening the game link, the Math function will be activated by default.
* Choose your answer by clicking on the appropriate option.
* If your answer is correct, a new question will be generated automatically.
* If your answer is incorrect, an audible alert will sound and the game will await your next selection.



## Next Features:

* Spelling Bee Category
* Science Category
* Social Category
* Drag and Drop function



## Challenges:

As a beginner in the realm of coding, I find every aspect to be both challenging and daunting. The task of planning is particularly difficult; I often find myself unsure of where to start, how to code, and which codes to use. However, being a highly visual person, I’ve found that starting with sketches and lists helps me organize my thoughts. I jot down what I want to achieve, decide on a color palette, and outline the features of the games.

Throughout this journey, two quotes have served as my guiding principles: “Don’t Repeat Yourself” and “If it’s working, don’t touch it.” These mantras have kept me focused and productive in the face of challenges.
