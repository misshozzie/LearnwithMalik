## Challenges:

As a beginner in the realm of coding, I find every aspect to be both challenging and daunting. The task of planning is particularly difficult; I often find myself unsure of where to start, how to code, and which codes to use. However, being a highly visual person, I’ve found that starting with sketches and lists helps me organize my thoughts. I jot down what I want to achieve, decide on a color palette, and outline the features of the games.

Throughout this journey, two quotes have served as my guiding principles: “Don’t Repeat Yourself” and “If it’s working, don’t touch it.” These mantras have kept me focused and productive in the face of challenges.
