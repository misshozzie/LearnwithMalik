## Challenges:

My journey in game development presented several challenges, primarily stemming from the need to incorporate my instructors' suggested features. The task of creating my very first game and integrating additional elements into the one you've already seen was a monumental challenge in itself. Also, I am a slow in reaction, since im an artist, everything I do must flow with my monumental. It takes me awhile to digest my instructors teaching. But I know that once I get use to the coding itself, these could be my playground one day.

And one of the most significant hurdles also was the process of inserting the required coding. This task demanded meticulous attention to detail and a deep understanding of programming principles. It involved not only writing new lines of code but also carefully integrating them into the existing framework.

Another major challenge was the strategic thinking required to determine where to place the new logic. Game development is like solving a complex puzzle, and deciding how to seamlessly integrate new features while maintaining the overall gameplay experience was no small feat. This often meant revisiting and reworking existing components to ensure everything worked harmoniously.


## favorite Code:

"My favorite piece of code in this game is:

*if (operator === '-' && a < b) { [a, b] = [b, a];}*

This if statement checks 2 conditions. and if both conditions are true, this inside curly bracket will be executed.

What I like about this is... This code is simple and concise, yet it accomplishes a meaningful task (swapping two variables if a condition is met). 
The use of array destructuring to swap variables in JavaScript is considered an elegant solution because it doesn't require a temporary variable.
This code could be part of a larger function where the order of *a* and *b* matters when the operator is *-*, making it a crucial piece of logic.
This piece of code might have helped me understand some important concepts in JavaScript, such as comparison operators, logical operators, if statements, and array destructuring.
